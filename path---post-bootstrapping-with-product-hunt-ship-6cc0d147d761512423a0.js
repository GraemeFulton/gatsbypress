Product Hunt&#8217;s free version of Ship saved me putting together a sign up form and define the product through their Upcoming Page:</p>\n<h2>Create a tagline</h2>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-664" src="http://localhost:8888/content-otter/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-23.29.41-300x170.png" alt="" width="300" height="170" /></p>\n<p>The tagline needs to sum up the product in a quick tagline, so helps you focus on the precise problem your solving.</p>\n<h2>Upcoming Page</h2>\n<p>The Upcoming Page helps you build a page to introduce your product, and offer people a way to sign up for updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce yourself<br />\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-661" src="http://localhost:8888/content-otter/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-23.21.35-300x194.png" alt="" width="300" height="194" /></li>\n<li>Describe the product in few sentences<br />\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-662" src="http://localhost:8888/content-otter/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-23.26.25-300x65.png" alt="" width="300" height="65" /></li>\n<li>Explain why people should subscribe<br />\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-663" src="http://localhost:8888/content-otter/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-23.27.23-300x136.png" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Send Messages</h2>\n<p>The messages feature saves you signing up to an email service, and the free version shows some basic analytics, like open rates:<br />\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-665" src="http://localhost:8888/content-otter/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-23.31.36-300x77.png" alt="" width="300" height="77" /></p>\n<p>For free this is good! But to upgrade and get more features it costs around $50, which seems a bit too much for a bootstrapped product.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-666" src="http://localhost:8888/content-otter/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-23.35.52-300x206.png" alt="" width="300" height="206" /></p>\n<p>Also, I don&#8217;t think many people have actually discovered the product on the Product Hunt platform, but from me sharing it outside. So the main benefits so far have been the speed I could set up a coming soon page, and it&#8217;s got me 50 sign ups before this site even existed:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-670" src="http://localhost:8888/content-otter/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sea_Otter_Enhydra_lutris_25169790524_crop-300x274.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="274" /><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-667" src="http://localhost:8888/content-otter/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-23.36.33-275x300.png" alt="" width="275" height="300" /></p>\n<p>Overall, I think it&#8217;s great, and will continue using it alongside this blog. Their pricing makes sense if the product is already making money, but $50 a month before earning a penny myself makes no sense :/</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-660" src="http://localhost:8888/content-otter/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-03-at-23.14.55-300x164.png" alt="" width="300" height="164" /></p>\n',featured_media:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{resolutions:{src:"/blog/static/319f7d58838f31f9b542c3476f67eaed-1fa9300923455f0d9e71c585ad2e80a8-21fa6.png",width:500,height:300},original:{width:2e3,height:536,src:"/blog/static/319f7d58838f31f9b542c3476f67eaed-1fa9300923455f0d9e71c585ad2e80a8.png"}}}}}},pathContext:{id:"498944cf-3dba-5094-a529-ce18f8e395c8"}}}});
