As you know, side projects can be challenging to see through, so thanks for following as it&#8217;s really helped keep me committed. If you have a side project of your own, I&#8217;d recommend sharing the making of it in this way too &#8211; I&#8217;d definitely join you!</p>\n<p>Check out the new features I&#8217;ve added to Email Otter in the time I&#8217;ve found over the last 2 weeks:</p>\n<h1>New Features</h1>\n<p>Email Otter has come a long way:</p>\n<p>💾 Autosave your edits (save and continue editing later)</p>\n<p>📝 Guides for editing</p>\n<p>👤 User accounts with project pages</p>\n<p>🖌Tidied up the layout</p>\n<p>📂Made a &#8216;dashboard&#8217; page for letters</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the video to highlight those features:</p>\n<div class="wrapper_b5bbb"><iframe class="video_18ea7" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYYQKeS0PoU" frameborder="0" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>\n<h1></h1>\n<p>Even though it&#8217;s been 2 weeks, it&#8217;s all actually been done in around 3 days overall, so it&#8217;s not bad progress. I even made that video just in the last hour just for this update too. If you&#8217;re curious, I used using a tool called <a href="https://rocketium.com/#_r_graeme93" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rocketium</a> to make it (and that&#8217;s my affiliate link).</p>\n<h1>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to add next for this project:</p>\n<p><strong><u>Blog</u></strong></p>\n<p>An Email Otter landing page, with a blog connected where I can republish these updates. Nothing fancy, I&#8217;ll write about what I used to make it on the blog.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Launch Date</u></strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to put a schedule together with a launch date. It will be for the beta version so you can start testing it soon!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>On launch, I&#8217;m going to need a few HTML templates for the Otter Library. So if you have any in mind, let me know.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all for now. Thanks again for subscribing, and if you have any questions about what I&#8217;m doing or the tools I&#8217;m using, just ask.</p>\n',featured_media:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{resolutions:{src:"/static/23abb8e6b79e6fbaac6c989a849209f9-af89ecb66a904308643267afe5e48ad7-1c495.jpg",width:500,height:300},original:{width:1366,height:768,src:"/static/23abb8e6b79e6fbaac6c989a849209f9-af89ecb66a904308643267afe5e48ad7.jpg"}}}}}},pathContext:{id:"75e73b05-b41f-5ecb-8c84-3eaa5e96d852"}}}});
